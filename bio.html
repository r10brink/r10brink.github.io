<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

	<p>I was born on the dead planet Krypton, sent light years away as an infant when my parents believed our planet was in grave danger. My adoptive parents found me and raised me as their own - as a denizen of Earth. Discovering I had powers pedestrian on Krypton but superior on Earth, I decided to use them for good. I currently live, work, and am generally heroic in the Boston area.</p>

<h2>Education and Experience</h2>

	<p>I was educated at Smallville High but never attended college. After moving from my small town I found a job at a major city newspaper, The Daily Planet, as journalist extrodinaire. I've worked on many groundbreaking news articles, often involving major crimes of the week.</p>
